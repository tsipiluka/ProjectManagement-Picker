        Scrum is an agile framework for project management that helps teams solve complex problems by creating adaptive
        solutions. Scrum is as simple and easy to apply as possible. It is deliberately incomplete in order to adapt
        more easily to different organizational structures. It tries to define empirical processes based on the needs of
        the teams. It is an iterative and incremental approach based on transparency, control and adaptation. This means
        that the entire process should be designed in such a way that both the team members and the customer have an
        overview of the current status of the project at all times.

        <ul>
            <li> Quickly share information across the team.</li>
            <li> Consistent achievements by accomplishing even small tasks that immediately show the
                progress. </li>
            <li> High visibility of progress. </li>
            <li> The entire process leads to a better understanding of effective processes within businesses.
            </li>
            <li> Scrum ensures customer satisfaction by optimizing turnaround time and responsiveness based on their
                their requests are optimized. </li>
            <li> Scrum leads to a higher product quality than classical project management methods. </li>
            <li> The high flexibility leads to a better handling of unexpected problems or changes without losing
                control of the project,
                without losing control of the project. </li>
            <li> The high focus on communication simplifies the work for both the customer and the
                employees is simplified. </li>
            <li> Despite the high level of agility, Scrum is a continuous process. </li>
            <li> Estimates of the amount of work required can be made more easily. </li>
        </ul>

            <p class="subtitle">Cons:</p>
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li> Members of the team suffer from great psychological pressure, as they have to present their work every
                day. </li>
            <li> If the processes are not implemented correctly, problems may arise within the team. </li>
            <li> In practice, a large amount of documentation is often lost compared to classic
                project management methods. </li>
            <li> Results are highly dependent on the dedication of team members. If team members
                do not cooperate, the project fails. </li>
            <li> Above a team size of 10 people, the implementation of Scrum becomes more difficult, as communication is
                no longer
                is no longer effective. </li>
            <li> Even if the process is split into several Scrum teams, it becomes much more difficult, as the effort
                required for communication increases significantly. </li>
            <li> In practice, Scrum is often more suitable for internal product development than for an external
                customer. </li>
            <li> If the customer has only a rough idea of the product, the development is also often planned too
                imprecisely. </li>
        </ul>
