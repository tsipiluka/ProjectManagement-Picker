        The waterfall model is one of the most widely used methods, especially in software development. It belongs to the sequential traditional models. The model has different phases, which must be run off in a certain order. Thereby, a new phase can only be started when the previous phase has been completed. The following phases are observed in the model:<br><br>
        1. Requirements Engineering<br>
        2. Design and Implementation<br>
        3. Testing<br>
        4. Release<br>
        5. Maintenance<br><br>

        The first phase of the waterfall model is the requirements engineering phase. In this phase, the requirements for the product are described in detail. The requirements of the customers and, if applicable, other stakeholders are recorded and documented. Fixed deadlines are defined and the resources and costs for implementing the project are estimated. In the second phase, the system to be created is first designed and then implemented. Especially in software development, the tools and technologies used are bundled in the design phase and an architecture of the system is designed. In the third phase, the system is tested to ensure that it is ready for release. All functional requirements are tested. All non-functional requirements in software projects, which the customer has requested depending on the use case, are also tested for their appropriateness and quality. In the Release phase, the solution is accepted by the customer. The system is transferred to production and the customer is provided with the relevant documentation and instructions. The last phase speaks of a maintenance phase. Depending on what agreements have been made with the customer, the responsibility for maintenance may lie in the hands of the developers. In this case, the system is maintained on request and optimized if necessary.

        <ul>
            <li>Risk of incorrect planning due to the increasing complexity in the demands of e.g.: Customers</li>
            <li>It is not always possible to define all requirements directly at the beginning in the planning phase</li>
            <li>Error handling in the middle of the project is usually very costly</li>
            <li>Due to the importance of the planning phase, a great deal of time is invested in this phase</li>
            <li>Changing customer requirements in the middle of the project can usually not be taken into account</li>
            <li>Signing off on organizational matters at each stage leads to increased effort and expense</li>
            <li>Problems are postponed to the next phase so that the time schedule is adhered to</li>
            <li>Customer feedback is obtained only at the end of the project</li>
            <li>A finished software is provided only at the end of the project without previous prototypes</li>
